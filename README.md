# Stock_Market_Dashboard_Project
Built a responsive stock market dashboard using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to visualize real-time stock trends. Implemented interactive charts with moving averages (MA20 &amp; MA50), volume analysis, and multiple time ranges. Integrated live market data API with validated stock selection and a professional dark UI.
